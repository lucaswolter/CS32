# Project 4: Genome Matching Library

- Created library program in C++ that parses info from text files to store genome data in vector & “Trie” structures
- Implemented “Trie” class to map genome info to DNA sequence fragments in a tree of individual character nodes
- Programmed algorithms to match genomes with slightly differing DNA sequences using “Trie” structure
