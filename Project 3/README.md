# Project 3: Zombie Dash

### Goal:
The general goal of this project was to create a zombie game using inheritance and polymorphism on a large scale. Most files were provided
by the professor, however the following files were written by myself:
- `Actor.h`
- `Actor.cpp`
- `StudentWorld.h`
- `StudentWorld.cpp`

For more information regarding the guidelines of this project, refer to `spec.pdf`.

### Instructions:
Download the full Project 3 folder and open `ZombieDash.sln`. On line 27 of `main.cpp`, change the asset directory to the file path of the
Assets folder. Running the program should now work smoothly.
